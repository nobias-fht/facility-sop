#Data Transfer SOP

### Definitions: 

<i>facility drive</i>: The shared storage located at /facility/imganfac

<i>user drive</i>: The shared storage located at /facility/imganfacusers

<i>data owner</i>: The group that generated the data and is requesting services

### Receipt of data from users
    
    Data will be transferred by adding the user to the user drive
    
    Users can create a folder in the user drive and place their data there
    
    As we cannot control who has access to which folders in the user drive, all data should be removed from the user drive a soon as possible and placed in the appropriate location in the facility drive drive
    
### Storage and sharing of data
    
    No data will leave the facility drive for any other location with express consent of the data owner with the exception of transfer to the /facility/imganfacusers drive for transfer back to the data owner.
    
    If it is necessary to transfer data from the share drive to any other location, this will only be done with the express written consent of the data owner, using the following procedure
    
    An email will be send to the data owner (in this case, the project contact person and their group leader) specifying:
    
    All files that will be transferred (in the case of large numbers of files, this may be specific in a csv attached to the email)
    
        - Where and to whom the files will be transferred
    
        - The purpose of the transfer
    
         - A request for written confirmation from the project contact person and the group leader
    
    No files will be transferred until both written confirmations are received (in the case where the group leader is also the contact person, only one confirmation is required)
    
### Data transfer back to the user
    
    Data transfer back to the user will be accomplished by placing and data into the user drive and informing the user immediately via email that the data is available for transfer
