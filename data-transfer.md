# Data Transfer SOP

### Definitions: 

<i>facility drive</i>: The shared storage located at /facility/imganfac

<i>user drive</i>: The shared storage located at /facility/imganfacusers

<i>data owner</i>: The group that generated the data and is requesting services

### Receipt of data from users
    
Data will be transferred by adding the user to the user drive

Users can create a folder in the <i>user drive</i> to put their data in

As we cannot control who has access to which folders in the <i>user drive</i>, all data should be removed from the <i>user drive</i> a soon as possible and placed in the appropriate location in the <i>facility drive</i>.
    
### Storage and sharing of data
    
No data will leave the <i>facility drive</i> for any other location with express consent of the data owner with the exception of transfer to the <i>facility drive</i>  drive for transfer back to the data owner.

If it is necessary to transfer data from the <i>facility drive</i>  to any other location, this will only be done with the express written consent of the data owner, using the following procedure

An email will be send to the data owner (in this case, the both project contact person and their group leader) specifying:

* A list of all files that will be transferred (in the case of large numbers of files, this may be specific in a csv attached to the email)

* Where and to whom the files will be transferred

* The purpose of the transfer

* A request for written confirmation from the project contact person and the group leader

No files will be transferred until both written confirmations are received (in the case where the group leader is also the contact person, only one confirmation is required)
    
### Data transfer back to the user
    
Data transfer back to the user will be accomplished by placing and data into the <i>user drive</i> and informing the user immediately via email that the data is available for transfer
